- use render mcp to deploy and monitor deploy logs after we are done writing the code and pushing to github
- when doing changes to postgre sql on render changes, ensure migration is done correctly and view from render mcp if the right data is at right places
- always ensure css is in main.css file only - no inline css in html, no inline css in js
- always create .md plan file first - and categories them in 3 phases; 1. identification of the issue, 2. plan to resolve the issue, 3. testing the reloved issue. Important Note - Delete the created the .md file after 3 is complete. Important Note - Neve delete the CLAUDE.md file this has important memory
- try and reuse the exisiting css from the main.css file rather adding new css code when new elements are created, this will ensure consistency accros pages and element - if you find something which is like a duplicate ensure you keep only one and edit the html and js to reuse the css.
- always try and use google fonts and goole material icons or logos whereever required.
