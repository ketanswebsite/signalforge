## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Commands!)

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
scoop install stripe
```

Don't have Scoop? Download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest

### Step 2: Run Auto-Setup

Double-click: **`stripe-auto-setup.bat`**

Or run in terminal:
```bash
cd "path\to\your\project"
stripe-auto-setup.bat
```

**That's it!** The script will:
1. Check Stripe CLI installation
2. Login to Stripe (opens browser)
3. Capture webhook secret
4. Update your `.env` automatically
5. Show you next steps

---

## 🎯 Testing Flow

Once setup is complete:

### 1. Start Your Server
```bash
npm start
```

Look for: `✓ Stripe payment routes loaded successfully`

### 2. Start Webhook Listener

Double-click: **`run-stripe-webhook.bat`**

Or run:
```bash
run-stripe-webhook.bat
```

Keep this window open!

### 3. Test Payments

Go to: http://localhost:3000/pricing.html

#### Test Free Trial (No Payment)
1. Click "Start Free Trial" on FREE plan
2. Should redirect to success page
3. Check database for new subscription

#### Test Paid Subscription
1. Click "Get Started" on any paid plan
2. On checkout page, use test card:
   - **Card:** 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - **Expiry:** 12/34 (any future date)
   - **CVC:** 123 (any 3 digits)
   - **ZIP:** 12345 (any 5 digits)
3. Click "Complete Subscription"
4. Watch webhook listener show: `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Should redirect to success page

---

## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When User Subscribes:

```
1. User clicks "Get Started" → Checkout page
2. User enters card details → Stripe Elements
3. Frontend calls → /api/stripe/create-subscription
4. Backend creates → Payment Intent in Stripe
5. Backend creates → Subscription record (status: pending)
6. User completes payment → Stripe processes
7. Stripe sends webhook → /api/stripe/webhook
8. Backend receives → payment_intent.succeeded
9. Backend updates → Subscription status to "active"
10. User sees → Success page
```

### Database Changes:

```sql
-- New record in user_subscriptions
INSERT INTO user_subscriptions (
  user_email,
  plan_code,
  status,  -- 'pending' → 'active'
  ...
)

-- New record in payment_transactions
INSERT INTO payment_transactions (
  user_email,
  amount,
  status,  -- 'completed'
  ...
)

-- New record in subscription_history
INSERT INTO subscription_history (
  event_type,  -- 'created' or 'payment_succeeded'
  ...
)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Stripe CLI not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
scoop install stripe
# Or download from GitHub releases
```

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"
**Fix:**
1. Stop server
2. Run: `run-stripe-webhook.bat`
3. Copy new secret (whsec_...)
4. Update `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_new_secret`
5. Restart server

### Issue: "Payment succeeds but subscription not activated"
**Check:**
1. Is webhook listener running? (`run-stripe-webhook.bat`)
2. Does server show webhook received?
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Verify webhook secret matches

### Issue: "Checkout page shows 'Payment system not configured'"
**Check:**
1. Are Stripe keys in `.env`?
2. Did you restart server after adding keys?
3. Check server logs for Stripe initialization errors
