## 📋 Available Bot Commands

Users can send these commands anytime:

- `/start` - Subscribe to all signals
- `/start conviction` - Subscribe to only 7 AM trades
- `/start scans` - Subscribe to only scan results
- `/status` - Check subscription status

## 🔧 How the System Works

### Database Structure
- All subscribers stored in `telegram_subscribers` table (PostgreSQL)
- Tracks: chat_id, username, subscription_type, active status
- Three subscription types:
  - `all` - Everything
  - `conviction` - Only 7 AM trades
  - `scans` - Only scan results

### Broadcasting System
When the 7 AM cron triggers:
1. Scanner runs high conviction scan
2. **Automatically broadcasts to ALL active subscribers** with `conviction` or `all` subscription
3. Respects Telegram rate limits (30 messages per batch)
4. Updates subscriber activity timestamps

### Current Status
✅ **Broadcasting is LIVE** - The cron already uses `broadcastToSubscribers()`
✅ **Database is ready** - telegram_subscribers table exists
✅ **Bot commands working** - /start, /stop, /status all functional
✅ **Webhook configured** - Production mode uses webhooks (no polling)
