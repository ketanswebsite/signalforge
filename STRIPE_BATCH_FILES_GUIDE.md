# Stripe Batch Files Guide

I've created 4 batch files to make Stripe webhook setup easier on Windows. Here's how to use them:

---

## üìÅ Batch Files Overview

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **setup-stripe-webhook.bat** | Interactive setup with instructions | First time setup |
| **stripe-auto-setup.bat** | Automatic secret capture & .env update | Quick automated setup |
| **run-stripe-webhook.bat** | Keep webhook listener running | During testing |
| **setup-stripe-local.bat** | Basic manual setup | If others fail |

---

## üöÄ Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI (One-time)

**Option A - Using Scoop (Easiest):**
```bash
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe
```

**Option B - Manual Download:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest
2. Download `stripe_X.X.X_windows_x86_64.zip`
3. Extract to `C:\stripe`
4. Add `C:\stripe` to your Windows PATH

### Step 2: Run Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Double-click: **`stripe-auto-setup.bat`**

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Check if Stripe CLI is installed
2. ‚úÖ Login to Stripe (opens browser)
3. ‚úÖ Capture webhook secret automatically
4. ‚úÖ Update your `.env` file
5. ‚úÖ Show you next steps

**If successful**, you'll see:
```
SUCCESS! Webhook secret has been saved to .env

Next steps:
  1. Restart your Node.js server: npm start
  2. In a NEW terminal, run: run-stripe-webhook.bat
  3. Keep that terminal open while testing
  4. Visit: http://localhost:3000/pricing.html
```

### Step 3: Run Webhook Listener During Testing

Double-click: **`run-stripe-webhook.bat`**

Keep this window open while testing payments!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Stripe CLI not found"

**Problem:** Stripe CLI is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if installed
stripe --version

# If not found, install:
scoop install stripe

# Or add to PATH manually if already downloaded
```

### "Login failed"

**Problem:** Browser didn't complete authentication

**Solution:**
1. Close all Stripe CLI windows
2. Run: `stripe login` manually
3. Complete authentication in browser
4. Run the batch file again

### "Could not automatically capture secret"

**Problem:** Auto-setup couldn't extract webhook secret

**Solution:**
Use manual method:
1. Run: `setup-stripe-webhook.bat`
2. Copy the webhook secret manually (starts with `whsec_`)
3. Add to `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret`
4. Restart server

### ".env file not found"

**Problem:** Running batch file from wrong directory

**Solution:**
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to project folder: `cd "C:\path\to\stock-proxy"`
3. Run batch file: `stripe-auto-setup.bat`

### "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Problem:** Webhook secret in `.env` doesn't match

**Solution:**
1. Run `run-stripe-webhook.bat`
2. Copy the displayed secret (whsec_...)
3. Update in `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_new_secret`
4. Restart server

## üìù What Gets Added to .env

After running `stripe-auto-setup.bat`, your `.env` will have:

```env
# Stripe Payment Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_captured_secret_here  # ‚Üê Added by script
```

**In auto-setup window:**
```
